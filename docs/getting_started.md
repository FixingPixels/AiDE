# Getting Started with AiDE

## Overview

AiDE provides a structured approach to developing projects with AI assistance. It creates a standardized way for AI to understand your project context and maintain documentation.

## Quick Start

1. Clone AiDE:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/aide.git
   cd aide
   ```

2. Create your project:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/create_project.sh my-project
   ```

3. Start a conversation with your AI assistant:
   - Point it to your `.context` directory
   - Begin discussing your project goals

## Detailed Setup Guide

### Step 1: Project Discussion
Begin by having a conversation with your AI assistant about your project. Cover these key topics:

1. Problem Statement
   - What problem are you solving?
   - Who are the users/stakeholders?
   - What is the current situation?

2. Project Goals
   - What are your primary objectives?
   - What defines success?
   - What is explicitly out of scope?

3. Technical Considerations
   - What technologies are you considering?
   - What are your constraints?
   - What are your quality requirements?

### Step 2: Project Initialization

The AI will help you:

1. Create project scope documentation
2. Perform technical assessment
3. Set up project structure
4. Initialize documentation
5. Plan initial tasks

### Step 3: Development Workflow

Each development session:

1. **Session Start**
   - Point AI to `.context` directory
   - Discuss session goals
   - Review current state

2. **During Development**
   - AI maintains documentation
   - AI tracks decisions
   - AI updates progress

3. **Session End**
   - AI summarizes changes
   - AI updates status
   - AI commits documentation

## Directory Structure

```
your-project/
├── .context/              # AI context directory
│   ├── current_state.md   # Project status
│   ├── environment.md     # Technical environment
│   ├── decisions/         # Architecture decisions
│   ├── tasks/            # Task tracking

├── docs/                 # Project documentation
└── [your project files]
```

## Best Practices

1. **AI Collaboration**
   - Start each session with context review
   - Let AI maintain documentation
   - Have AI explain decisions
   - Review AI's updates

2. **Documentation**
   - Keep focused on current state
   - Document decisions as they're made
   - Track tasks and progress
   - Maintain session history

3. **Version Control**
   - Commit documentation with code
   - Use conventional commits
   - Review AI's documentation PRs
